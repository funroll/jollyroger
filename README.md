# Warning: No longer works!

This code doesn't work any more. If you want to fix it, feel free to send a PR.

# Overview

jollyroger is a Google Chrome Extension to kill processes without closing tabs. It uses the [experimental processes api](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/experimental.processes.html).

When you click the icon, jollyroger will loop through all open tabs (in all windows) and kill the associated processes. This preserves your windows and the tabs contained therein, but improves overall system performance by reducing CPU and (especially) memory consumption.

The killed tabs can be refreshed to bring them back to life, so you don't lose your work.

Beware that other Chrome Extensions will probably be killed along with tab rendering processes.

# Installation

## Enable Experimental Extension APIs
- In a new tab, enter `chrome://flags` in the address bar
- Scroll down to "Experimental Extension APIs"
- Click "Enable"
- Restart Chrome

## Install the jollyroger Extension
- Click [here](https://github.com/funroll/jollyroger/blob/master/jollyroger.crx?raw=true) to download the .crx file
- Click the three line "burger button" icon --> Tools --> Extensions
- Drag the downloaded jollyroger.crx file into the body of the Extensions page
(Note that this no longer works from the download icon in Chrome directly. Now you have the find the file in the filesystem and drag it in (e.g. from Finder)


Now you're ready to reclaim memory and processing power from tabs you're not actively using.
